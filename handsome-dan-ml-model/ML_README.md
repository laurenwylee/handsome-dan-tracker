```scrapedawg.py``` is not needed to run the application, but was rather used to scrape images from @handsomedanyale on instagram for model training and validation.

Create and activate a conda environment with relevant packages before running ```predict.py```. The pretrained model weights are in ```handsome_dan_detector_model.pth```.
